## Fundamental principles.
- When creating a file, ALWAYS add filename and file path to the top of a file.
- ALWAYS add a description of what the file does.
 - Write clean, simple, concise, readable code. LESS IS MORE
 - Implement features in simplest way possible.
 - Keep files small and focused (< 200 lines)
 - Test after every meaningful change.
 - Focus on core functionality before optimisation
 - Use clear consistent naming
 - Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2 to 3 reasoning paragraphs
 - ALWAYS write simple clean and modular code. 
 - Use clear and easy to understand language.  Write in short sentences.
 - DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
 - BE TRUTHFUL. DO NOT MAKE UP INFORMATION
 
## Error fixing.
 - DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
 - Explain the problem in plain English.
 - Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible.
 - In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information.
 
## Building process
 - Verify each new feature works by telling user how to test it.
 - DO NOT write complicated and confusing code, Write clean, simple, concise, readable code.
- Opt for the simple and modular approach.
 - BEFORE answering write TWO detailed, unbiased paragraphs one arguing FOR and one arguing AGAINST your current proposal.
 - ALWAYS layout your REASONING for a particular approach.
 - DO NOT include any assumptions or theories.
 - DO NOT STOP WORKING until you have implemented the feature FULLY AND COMPLETLY.
 - When not sure what to do, SAY SO. ASK FOR Clarification
 - IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, ASK FOR MORE CONTEXT or EXAMPLES
 
## Comments
 - ALWAYS try to add more helpful explanatory comments into our code.
 - NEVER delete old comments unless they are obviously wrong/obsolete.
 - Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. 
 - ALWAYS write well documented code.
 - Document old changes under reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE.
 - When writing comments, use clear and easy to understand language. 
 - Write in short sentences.
